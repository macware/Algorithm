Think indexing/Counting carefully
(1) 0 start:
	a. the current one is in question
(2) 1 start:
	a. the next one is in question

Use data structures to solve the problem:
(1) stack: 
	a. previous element might be used to verify later result
	b. a result can only be obtained when a corresponding later element is found
	
(2) hash: intersection check or fast look up

Use concurrent marching
